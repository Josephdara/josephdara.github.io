           I write Solidity mostly, but also currently learning Rust. I am a Smart Contract Engineer and Auditor with vast experience in writing Solidity smart contracts and deeper understanding of the EVM. 
I use Foundry, Hardhat and Remix for smart contract writing, testing and fuzz testing . I also use automated tools like Slither and Echidna. I have experience working with different smart contracts, including: AMMs, Fungible and Nonfungible tokens, Staking contract, Account Abstraction, Vaults, Proxies and Upgradeable contracts, as well as building personalized smart contracts.  
I am a security minded engineer and I currently do smart contract audits at Code4rena and Sherlock . I also participate in different CTFs and I have completed a few such as Ethernaut from Openzeppelin, DamnVunerableDefi, Secureum Bootcamp and more.
